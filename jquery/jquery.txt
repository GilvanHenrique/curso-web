    jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies the JS programming. With this tool,
it's possible manipulate the DOM (HTML and CSS), activity HTML events, effects and animations,
beyong AJAX requests.  
    The flag of this library is "write less, do more.". He simplifies the DOM manipulation
and AJAX calls. jQuery is the most popular and extendable JS library.
    There are two versions for downloading, the production version (minified), and the
development version, beyong CDN puting with the HTML tag <script>, that shold be inside at 
<head> section. The CDN has the advantage because load from cache of the users, becoming faster.
    The fundamental of syntax is that jQuery select HTML elements, and perform actions on them.
The basic syntax is: $(selector).action(). For exemple: $(".test").hide() - hides all elements 
with class="test". All jQuery methods are inside a document ready event: 
    $(document).ready(function(){  
        // the methods
        // $(function() { //methods }) is the short form
    })

    The jQuery selectors is based on the CSS selectors:
    $("button") name for elements
    $("#test") # for id
    $(".test") . for classes
    $(this) for current elements
    $("[href]") for attributes
    $("tr:first") for first row of a table

    An event represents the moment when something happens, like moving a mouse over an element,
selecting a radio button, or clicking on an element. There are four event types: 
    mouse: click, dblclick, mouseenter, mouseleave;
    keyboard: keypress, keydown, keyup;
    form: submit, change, focus, blur;
    document/window: load, resize, scroll, unload.
    The on method select one or more events.
